# School Performances in NYC

## Overview

The Department of Education (DOE) in NYC is important to investigate. It was reported in 2022 that 30.7% accounts for the cities total expenditure. With this study, we would like to understand the performance of schools, and how the city can improve on its current system. Specifically, create a dashboard that can be utilized by state officials to determine which schools might need additional fundings, resources, support systems, and etc. More funding does not imply that the school will eventually be better, but it does allow us to ask specific questions that might help improve underperforming schools.

There are performance levels that indicate if a student did or did not meet a learning standard.

- Level 1 - Students performing at this level are well below proficient in standards for their grade.
- Level 2 - Students performing at this level are partially proficient in standards for their grade.
- Level 3 - Students performing at this level are proficient in standards for their grade.
- Level 4 - Students performing at this level excel in standards for their grade.


## Goal

Pull data from the Socrata API and build an interactive dashboard that can be used to examine performance of schools in NYC. The dashboard will allow city officials to determine which schools to further assist.
